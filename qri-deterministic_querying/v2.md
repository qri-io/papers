<b>Abstract</b>
</p>

The current infrastructure that underlies the distribution and processing of data on the Internet has enabled dramatic advances in a great variety of human endeavors.  Unfortunately, while today's technologies and architectures obviously do work, they incorporate systemic inefficiencies that impede effective large-scale discovery, distribution, preservation and reuse of data sets.  An important source of inefficiencies is rooted in the database-centered pipeline that underlies much of data processing on the Internet today.  The ongoing transition to a content-addressed _permanent web_ offers an opportunity to overcome some of these architectural inefficiencies.  By combining formalized resource descriptions, formalized query definitions, linked metadata, and a content-addressed file system, we define an approach that supports efficient, database-free reuse of data and data processing results that scales to the global Internet.


# Introduction

Open data is a boon to research and progress.  The continuing growth of data being made available on the Internet promises a windfall of benefits, enabling new discoveries, powering new innovations, increasing transparency
